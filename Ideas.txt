You are vacationing at a resort - The Pinncale Hotel - with a friend. 
	Meet people, hang out, have fun for 30ish moves
	-People you meet will mostly be hostile to you - idea is to not let
	the words and wants of strangers get to you
		-People will ask you to do things for them that impede your 
		enjoyment. Do you do what you want, or follow the wishes of others?
