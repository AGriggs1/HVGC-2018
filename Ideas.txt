You are vacationing at a resort - The Pinncale Hotel - with a friend. 
	Meet people, hang out, have fun for 30ish moves
	-People you meet will mostly be hostile to you - idea is to not let
	the words and wants of strangers get to you
		-People will ask you to do things for them that impede your 
		enjoyment. Do you do what you want, or follow the wishes of others?

10/25
-Calling the hotel the Sunrise Inn
-No friend: meet someone right away. Probably the only nice person their. They ask for your name, and that's how the player can use their own name
-Receptionist (or whatever you call the front desk person) can't find your reservation in the system. Spelling with name? Who knows (making the spelling error thing might be
too hard to implement). Gets snappy with you
-Family arguing in the parking lot
	-Father forget key item at home.
	-Mother upset.
	-Daughter won't stop whining.
	-No interaction beyond this for now
-Bellhop refuses to help with your bags (good thing you packed lightly!)
-Elevator initially out of order. Room not on ground floor (probably not implement former, I don't want to make this too long)
-Cafe has man on phone call. Tells you to sod off.
-Arcade has kid who won't talk to you until you have a certain item. 
-Hotel lounge (not on map, probably be in the lobby) has elderly lady. Very demanding, talks a lot.
-Hotel Entrance: Young woman, complains a lot (especially the bell hop). Asks you to take her bags to her room.	
-Cafe: Server refuses to serve you until you bring an order to someone at the pool (will hammer this out)
